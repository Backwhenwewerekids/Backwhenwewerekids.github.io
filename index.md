## Favorite CPSC Labs
* Lab 1: 

  This was my first favorite lab because it started off simple and it’s the easiest out of all the labs. Nothing too tedious as the current labs are so that’s why it was the best. It was just one simple line of code and nothing more, nothing less. It implemented the simplest code to use which was the standard output statement. And of course, we said the all famous coding line of “Hello World!” 

* Lab 5, part 1: 
  
  This next lab was another favorite because it started branching out to multiple files which added an extra challenge. It also made us practice using functions to properly calculate the area of a rectangle when the user inputs a given width and height. It was satisfying as always to see the fruits of our labor at the end, those sweet green checkmarks. 

* Lab 6, part 2: 

  This lab is my final favorite on this list. Here we had to implement the game of Blackjack into C++ and it sounded absurd and sure enough it was pretty difficult at the time. A lot of the classmates I talked to had never heard of Blackjack being coded like this and it was quite funny. I didn’t even know how to play Blackjack so I asked a friend who knew to teach me all the rules. We had to use to many if statements to make this one work and once again, seeing the program run as intended at the end was so relieving.
